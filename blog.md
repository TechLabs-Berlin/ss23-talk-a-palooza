# UX-Process 

### Personal Impresions :bricks::smiley:
It wasn't as easy as I thought to apply what I learned in practice. I soon realized that even the smallest steps, no matter how obvious they may seem, are crucial to achieving a good result. I learned that being attentive to the details is a must when you are a first-time designer dealing with Figma, UX processes, and research. Skipping steps can lead to a result that is only visible at the end and difficult to change. Moreover, it often requires double the amount of time to fix. The main takeaway from this experience is never to underestimate any required steps in the UX world.

### Problems :exploding_head::boom::building_construction:
Along with the technical problems I faced while using Figma and its features, I also encountered other issues along the way. This brings me to the second big lesson from this project phase: communicating effectively. I felt stuck and unsure of what to do at times because of my lack of experience and not knowing what was happening in the other tracks, mostly due to my lack of knowledge about the tasks they were doing. One problem I faced was not realising that I had to proactively go to every track to ask about all the functions and doable possibilities. I found myself assuming or waiting for directions, which was not helpful.

### Results and plan 	:european_castle::hugs::yellow_heart::sparkles:
Whit more organisation the plan came to an end. We had to take decisions together. For example, the initial assessment. We brainstormed together between tracks to determine the kind of information we needed from the user to make our platform work effectively. Categorizing the data we gathered was also a significant challenge we had to overcome. I still encountered many blocks while designing and perceive I need to keep learning, reading and doing to gain more capabilities. It was overall a very good first impression of the UX designer work and I am looking forward to gaining more experience in this area. 


Thank you for the opportunity Techlabs :+1:
