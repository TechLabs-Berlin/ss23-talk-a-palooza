# UX-Process 

### Personal Impresions :bricks::smiley:
It wasn't as easy as I thought to apply what I learned in practice. I soon realized that even the smallest steps, no matter how obvious they may seem, are crucial to achieving a good result. I learned that being attentive to the details is a must when you are a first-time designer dealing with Figma, UX processes, and research. Skipping steps can lead to a result that is only visible at the end and difficult to change. Moreover, it often requires double the amount of time to fix. The main takeaway from this experience is never to underestimate any required steps in the UX world.

### Problems :exploding_head::boom::building_construction:
Along with the technical problems I faced while using Figma and its features, I also encountered other issues along the way. This brings me to the second big lesson from this project phase: communicating effectively. I felt stuck and unsure of what to do at times because of my lack of experience and not knowing what was happening in the other tracks, mostly due to my lack of knowledge about the tasks they were doing. One problem I faced was not realising that I had to proactively go to every track to ask about all the functions and doable possibilities. I found myself assuming or waiting for directions, which was not helpful.

### Results and plan 	:european_castle::hugs::yellow_heart::sparkles:
Whit more organisation the plan came to an end. We had to take decisions together. For example, the initial assessment. We brainstormed together between tracks to determine the kind of information we needed from the user to make our platform work effectively. Categorizing the data we gathered was also a significant challenge we had to overcome. I still encountered many blocks while designing and perceive I need to keep learning, reading and doing to gain more capabilities. It was overall a very good first impression of the UX designer work and I am looking forward to gaining more experience in this area. 


Thank you for the opportunity Techlabs :+1:

### Intro

The promise of personalised experiences extends well beyond the consumption-based ventures it is typically associated with. Our team aimed to integrate this concept into our app, recognising the significant potential that personalisation holds for enhancing educational tools. Developing a strategy to provide personalised word recommendations for the app's pronunciation exercises was our track's primary focus.

### The data

The Wordbank dataset, offering a wealth of linguistic data related to children's language development, provided the foundation for our track's contribution to the project. In a crucial first step, we conducted preliminary explorations of the dataset. These explorations not only clarified to us which of the project's original goals were actually achievable and which were not, but also offered insights into the linguistic trajectories of our app's target audience: young children.


### Two models, one goal

Subsequently, we delved into research on recommendation models, particularly focusing on collaborative filtering techniques. Drawing from our research findings, we went on to create two different models: a graph-based LightGCN model and a memory-based KNN model, each offering distinct advantages and disadvantages. Both models were successfully deployed and offer API integration.
