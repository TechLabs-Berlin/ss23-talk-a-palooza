# Installation

### 1. Setting Up The Correct .env File:
To ensure that our credentials are not exposed on Github, we have set up a <code>.env</code> file containing necessary data to connect to our MongoDB Atlas database. 

The <code>.env</code> file contains all sensitive data necessary to run the app, including database credentials in the following format:
```
#MONGO CONFIG
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>.aj9zhtw.mongodb.net/<user>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
Therefore, to be able to run the app, please contact [Rose Jeantet](https://github.com/rjeantet) to receive the necessary credentials.

&nbsp;

### 2. Python Setup:
To receive remedy recommendation from the Data Science API, Python 3 needs to be installed. We used Python3.8 with FastAPI, so we recommend choosing the same version.

* [Download Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and [Installation Docs for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3.8/using/windows.html)
* [Python for Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) and [Installation Docs for Mac](https://docs.python.org/3.8/using/mac.html)

&nbsp;

### 3. Clone Into The Git Repository:
To pull this application to your local machine, execute the following commands from your command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/TechLabs-Berlin/ss23-talk-a-palooza.git
```

&nbsp;

### Install dependencies:
To run the app, you first need to install all required dependencies for the client, and servers (node and python)

&nbsp;
